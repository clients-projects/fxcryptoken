                            There is a risk involved with investing in all high
                            yield investment programs. However, there are a few
                            simple ways that can help you to reduce the risk of
                            losing more than you can afford to. First, align
                            your investments with your financial goals, in other
                            words, keep the money you may need for the
                            short-term out of more aggressive investments,
                            reserving those investment funds for the money you
                            intend to raise over the long-term. It's very
                            important for you to know that we are real traders
                            and that we invest members' funds on major
                            investments.
